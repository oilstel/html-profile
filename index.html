                    <h2>What do you want to learn in this course?</h2>
                    <p>Well I'll be teaching but I'm sure I'll learn new things from you along the way. In the next few weeks we are going to dive into the meat and potatoes of building websites and then we will refine our coding and debugging skills through workshops and assignments. Web development is mostly debugging so knowing how to do this is very important. Also, I hope that I can convey to you how fun it is to work on websites. There's really nothing like it. It can be a drag at times but most of the time it's just like drawing or any other creative process.</p>

                    <h2>Tell us about an early experience with computers or the internet</h2>
                    <p>I remember playing SimCity 2000 on my family's Mac. I would day dream about building new hotels and rush home everyday to play. The sound effects and the look and feel of the densely packed interface are particularly vivid in my memory. What is the SimCity of 2020?</p>

                    <h2>What will the web look like in 10 years from now?</h2>
                    <p>In 10 years most people will not access the web through a conventional browser. There's a lot of talk about social media becoming more like a video games. I'm not sure if a video game social network will be adopted widely but I do think that the web will be further divided into a text based web (in the browser) and private APIs (apps, social video games, etc). This split has already taken place but in 10 years the divide will be even greater and the browser based web will seem archaic.</p>
